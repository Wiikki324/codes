PLAYERCONTROLLER.CS<br/>
This is player controller script for my End-Project of  aMetropolia Online Unity Course, a 2D Platformer game. 

NOPPAPASIANSSI.py<br/>
In Finnish language, a text based "solitaire" game with dice. Goal is to get a straight / one of each value.<br/> For example 1,2,3,4,5,6 on 6d6, or 1,2,3,4 on  4d4.<br/>
game in action: https://youtu.be/fQqe0uSQERI<br/>
(A noppapasianssi 2, with a possibility for losing the game has become an "eternity-project"..)

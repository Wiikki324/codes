PLAYERCONTROLLER.CS<br/>
This is player controller script for my End-Project of  aMetropolia Online Unity Course, a 2D Platformer game. 

NOPPAPASIANSSI.py<br/>
In Finnish language, a text based "solitaire" game with dice. Goal is to get a straight / one of each value.<br/> For example 1,2,3,4,5,6 on 6d6, or 1,2,3,4 on  4d4.<br/>
game in action: https://youtu.be/fQqe0uSQERI<br/>
(A noppapasianssi 2, with a possibility for losing the game has become an "eternity-project"..)


The Player Controller is jus a player controller, and not even the most developed one at the moment (no coyotes or jump force adjustments), but it was good enough for the project

Noppapasianssi on the other hand is kind of my "dream come true" I was able to write the game, and test how long 10d10 solitaire takes. Although it is probably more in JAVA-style than in Python.
